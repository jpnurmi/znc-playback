An advanced playback module for ZNC
===================================

The advanced playback module for ZNC makes it possible for IRC clients
to avoid undesired repetitive buffer playback. IRC clients may request
the module to send a partial buffer playback starting from and ending
to a certain point of time. The detailed instructions are available at
http://wiki.znc.in/Playback.
